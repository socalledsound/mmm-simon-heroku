A multiplayer simon game I made for a class I was teaching.  The idea was to have a simon game that had interesting sound spatial qualities in a computer lab.  For this reason, only the sounds you make will come out of your device.  This also makes it a fun game for two or more players who are in one place.  On the other hand, it's pretty useless to people who are in different places.  May go back and add the option to change that at some point.
